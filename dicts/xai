isthmus of the fauces
it beats me
it beats the Dutch
it being provided
it can be supposed
it cannot be helped
it does not matter
it does not signify
it follows that
it has me guessing
it is all the same
it is certain
it is fated
it is for a fact
it is necessary
it is of no consequence
it is of no importance
it is proven
it is said
it is that
it is written
it makes no difference
it matters not
it may be
it might be thought
it must be
it must follow
it must have its way
it must needs be
it needs must be
it stands to reason
it will all come out in the wash
it will be
it would appear
it&t
it's God's will
it's Greek to me
it's all one to me
it's all the same to me
it's beyond me
it's in the cards
it's no go
it's too deep for me
